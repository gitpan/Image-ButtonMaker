EXAMPLE:

This is a small demonstration of the Image::ButtonMaker. It shows how
to use classes and button lists to generate a small batch of
buttons. It also shows how to use inheritance between button classes
to simplify class definitions.

Run the run.pl script generate the buttons and look at them in the
'buttons' directory.
